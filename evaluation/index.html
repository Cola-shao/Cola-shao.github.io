    <h2>Evaluation and Rank Methods:</h2>
    <p>
    <strong>Key requirements for the ranking process:</strong></br>
    The final rankings were determined by a weighted combination of three components: 
    <strong>Classification score: 40% weight, Segmentation score: 40% weight, and Processing Time score: 20% weight</strong>. 
    Considering that the objective of this task is to comprehensively evaluate the risk of fetal congenital heart 
    disease through both classification and segmentation, we deemed classification and segmentation to be more critical than processing time, 
    higher weights are assigned to these two aspects compared to processing time. This comprehensive evaluation aligns with the challenge’s objective to assess both 
    segmentation, classification, and computational performance, ensuring a multi-dimensional assessment of participants’ solutions. The overall score is calculated as follows:</br>
    <p>
        $$
        S_{total} = 0.4 * S_{cls} + 0.4 * S_{seg} + 0.2 * S_{time}
        $$
    </p>
        Where \( S_{cls} \) represents classification score,  \( S_{seg} \) represents segmentation score, and  \( S_{time} \) represents processing time score. Figure 1 illustrates the overall score framework of our challenge.</br>
    </p>
    <h3>1. Classification Score:</h3>
    <p>
         Class imbalance is an inherent issue in this task. To comprehensively evaluate classification performance, we adopt the mean F1-score across all classes as the final classification score. The calculation formula is as follows:</br>
    $$
    S_{cls} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} F1_i
    $$
        Where N denotes the total number of classes.</br>
    </p>
    <h3>2. Segmentation Score: </h3>
    <p>
        As shown in Figure 1, in the semi-supervised segmentation task, segmentation score is calculated based on the 
    segmentation performance of <strong>13 anatomical structures across four standard cardiac planes</strong>, with the final segmentation score 
    obtained by averaging the results across all structures and planes.</br>
        For each cardiac plane, the score is calculated based on two evaluation metrics — Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and Normalized Surface 
    Dice (NSD) — which are equally weighted (50%). Considering that all anatomical structures are of comparable clinical importance, each structure 
    contributes equally to the overall segmentation performance. The segmentation score is calculated as follows:</br>
    <p>
        $$
        S_{seg} = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{s=1}^{M} S(_s)
        $$
    </p>
        where
        $$
        S_{(s)} = \frac{DSC_{(s)} + NSD_{(s)}}{2}
        $$
        Here, s denotes the anatomical structure (e.g., atria, ventricles, great vessels, etc.), and M represents the total number of anatomical structures. 
    The final segmentation score is obtained by averaging the results across all M structures within the four standard cardiac views (four-chamber view, left 
    ventricular outflow tract view, right ventricular outflow tract view, and three-vessel–trachea view).</br>
    </p>
    <h3>3. Processing Time Score:</h3>
    <p>
        The total time was defined as the duration from the first to the last test case for each participant. To control for extreme values, the time usage was clipped relative to the baseline time as follows:</br>
            &#8226; If a participant’s time was ≤ 2/3 of the baseline time, their time usage was set to - (2/3 × baseline time). </br>
            &#8226; If a participant’s time was ≥ 2 of the baseline time, their time usage was set to -(2 × baseline time). </br>
            &#8226; Otherwise, it was set to - (total time).</br>
        After min-max normalization and score transformation was applied to yield a [0, 100] score. </br>
        The processing time score is calculated as follows:</br>
        $$
        S_{time} = \frac{(-t_{user}) - (-T_{max})}{(-T_{min}) - (-T_{max})} \times 100
        $$
        Where:</br>
        &#8226;  \( T_{uesr} \)  is the participant’s (clipped) total time usage;</br>
        &#8226;  \( T_{min} \)  = 2/3 × baseline time is the fastest acceptable case (upper bound);</br>
        &#8226;  \( T_{max} \)  = 2×baseline time is the slowest acceptable case (lower bound).</br>
    The baseline runtime will be released together with the dataset. </br>

    Figure 1. Each case includes B-mode fetal cardiac ultrasound images from four standard views: the four-chamber view (4CH), 
        left ventricular outflow tract view (LVOT), right ventricular outflow tract view (RVOT), and three-vessel–trachea view (3VT). 
        For each view, segmentation results and an independent classification result should be reported.</br>
