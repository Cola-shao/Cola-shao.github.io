    <h2>What is This Challenge?</h2>
    <p>
            The primary purpose of this Challenge is to address critical bottlenecks in prenatal Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) screening via fetal echocardiography (FE). 
        These bottlenecks include heavy reliance on highly specialized clinicians, inefficient manual annotation, diagnostic variability, data scarcity, 
        and domain shift—all of which hinder AI-driven automation. The Challenge focuses on two core tasks: fetal cardiac ultrasound view segmentation and diagnosis. 
        Its goal is to drive the development of robust, clinically translatable AI algorithms. To achieve this, it prioritizes evaluating three key algorithm capabilities: 
        segmentation/diagnosis accuracy, few-shot learning adaptability, and cross-clinical-setting generalization.
    </p>

    <h2>Tasks</h2>
    <p>
            The evaluation will be conducted independently for two distinct tracks. Participants can choose to submit to one or both tracks: 
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Track 1:</b> Fetal Heart Segmentation:</br>
        <b>Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC)</b>: used to measure the region error.</br>
        <b>Normalized Surface Dice (NSD)</b>: used to measure the difference between the segmentation result and the ground truth segmentation.</br>
        <b>Running time</b>: used to measure the inference speed.</br>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Track 2:</b> Fetal Heart disease diagnosis:</br>
        <b>F1-score:</b>: the mean F1-score across all classes.</br>
        <b>Running time</b>: used to measure the inference speed.</br>
    </p>
    <h2>Awards</h2>
    <p>
        We will provide cash prizes for the top 5 teams. A certificate will be awarded to the top 10 teams. The top 10 
        performing methods (teams) will be announced publicly and invited to give oral presentations during the ISBI 
        2026 conference.</br>
    </p>
    <h2>Sponsors</h2>
    <p>
        Mindray Bio-Medical Electronics Co., Ltd is the principal sponsor of the Challenge.</br>
        As a global leader in medical imaging, Mindray prioritizes advancing ultrasound for prenatal care. 
    It has invested heavily in R&D to develop cutting-edge ultrasound systems. These systems include specialized 
    transducers and AI-enhanced imaging, which support high-quality fetal cardiac imaging for millions of screenings 
    each year. By sponsoring this Challenge, Mindray aims to achieve three key goals:</br>
        Foster innovation: Enable global researchers to refine top-tier algorithms for fetal cardiac AI.</br>
        Bridge clinical-technical gaps: Connect engineers and clinicians, ensuring solutions align with real-world needs.</br>
        Advance standardization: Support the development of benchmark datasets and metrics for consistent clinical practice.</br>
        Ultimately, these efforts will empower healthcare providers with precise, accessible fetal cardiac tools. This will help reduce 
    missed CHD diagnoses and improve maternal-infant outcomes.</br>
